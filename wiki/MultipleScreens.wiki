#summary Working with multiple screens.

= Multiple Screens =

Working with multiple screens is actually pretty easy. Each "screen" is simply a Form. So, if you want another screen, create a new Form.

== How Do I start the next screen? ==

Let's say you have Splash, and MainMenu Forms created. Within the Splash file, you use an intent to start the mainmenu like so:

{{{
Intent intent = new Intent(this, MainMenu.class);
startActivity(intent);
}}}

That's it. If you don't want the splash screen to stay in memory, add finish(); after the startactivity line.

== How do I pass data to another Form upon loading? ==

Ok, so like the above, you use intents.

{{{
Intent intent = new Intent(this, MainMenu.class);
intent.putExtra("NAME_OF_DATA", data);
startActivity(intent);
finish();
}}}

You use the method putExtra to attach your data to the intent. Then, to retreive this data, in the MainMenu file within the $define() method, you grab the intent like so:

{{{
Intent intent = getIntent();
if (intent.hasExtra("NAME_OF_DATA")) {
   data = intent.getExtra("NAME_OF_DATA");
  }
}}}

Now, that last line will look a little different depending on the type of data you are passing. Examples:
{{{
// String extra
data = intent.getStringExtra("NAME_OF_DATA");
// Integer
data = intent.getIntExtra("NAME_OF_DATA", 0);
}}}

The 0 in the Intextra line is the default (if it doesnt find the value, it will give you the default value).
